# "Mousin' Around"

### Work in Progress

This is a small game made for the GMTK Game Jam of 2024. We were unable to get it working in the time frame.

## Theme: Built to Scale

## Premise:
Player is given an inventory of items to place on a level, then the game is played and the items become physics objects.
After using the placed objects to climb to the top of the map, the player eats a cheese and grows larger.
Now the same level is played with a larger scale. The bigger mouse character will be heavier and interact more aggressively with the placed objects.
This may lead the player to restart the level, in order to "build to scale". In order to  succeed you have to place objects strategicly to work with the future rat sizes.
